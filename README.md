# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repo contains a series of IPython Jupyter Notebooks where I've taken notes
on the book _[Data Structures and Algorithms in
Python](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19548248W)_ by Michael T. Goodrich,
Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser.

A `shell.nix` file is included which provides the `jupyter` dependency via
[jupyterWith](https://github.com/tweag/jupyterWith). The build can be sped up
significantly with [cachix](https://cachix.org/): `cachix use jupyterwith`.
